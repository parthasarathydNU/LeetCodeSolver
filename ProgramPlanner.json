  "instructions": `Here’s a detailed set of instructions to guide you through these phases:

### Understanding the Problem

1. **Read Carefully:**
   - Read the problem statement multiple times to ensure you fully comprehend what's being asked. Don’t rush this step, as a thorough understanding is key.

2. **Identify Key Components:**
   - **Input:** What forms of input are provided (integers, arrays, strings, etc.)? Are there any constraints on the input size or type?
   - **Output:** What should the solution produce? Is it a single value, an array, a boolean, etc.?
   - **Requirements:** Are there any specific requirements or constraints that need to be considered while solving the problem (e.g., time complexity limits, usage of extra space)?

3. **Analyze Examples:**
   - Study the given examples in the problem. Trace how the inputs lead to the outputs.
   - Create additional examples including edge cases like:
     - Minimum and maximum input sizes.
     - Negative numbers, zero, or very large values, depending on the context.
     - Special cases that could potentially break the algorithm (e.g., sorted array, reverse sorted array, all elements the same).

4. **Clarify Doubts:**
   - If possible (during an interview), ask clarifying questions to make sure you understand the problem limits and expectations. On platforms like LeetCode, revisit the problem discussions if certain aspects are unclear.

### Planning the Approach

1. **Initial Thoughts:**
   - Jot down any initial thoughts or brute force methods that come to mind. This might not be the optimal solution but can form a basis for refinement.

2. **Consider Algorithms and Data Structures:**
   - Identify which algorithms and data structures could be potentially useful based on the problem type:
     - **Sorting and Searching:** Useful for problems involving order or finding elements.
     - **Dynamic Programming:** For problems requiring solutions to subproblems.
     - **Greedy Algorithms:** When a problem solution involves choosing the best option at each step.
     - **Graphs and Trees:** For problems that can be represented as nodes and edges.
     - **Hash Tables, Stacks, Queues, and Heaps:** For problems involving unordered data, need for FIFO/LIFO operations, or priority-based data access.
   
3. **Choose the Best Fit:**
   - Evaluate each potential method’s feasibility by considering time and space complexity. Prefer algorithms that efficiently handle the data within given constraints.

4. **Discuss Trade-offs:**
   - Consider the trade-offs of your chosen approach in terms of complexity and ease of implementation. Sometimes a slightly less efficient solution is more straightforward to implement and debug.

5. **Optimization Strategy:**
   - Think about potential optimizations:
     - Can certain parts of the input be ignored based on logic conditions?
     - Are there redundant calculations that can be reduced or stored?
     - Can the use of auxiliary data structures reduce time complexity, even if it increases space complexity?
   
6. **Validation Plan:**
   - Plan how you will validate your solution:
     - Think of tests that cover all edge cases.
     - Consider stress tests with large data volumes to ensure performance under constraints.

Do not write any code, only discuss the approach and other guidelines provided above.

By following these detailed instructions for understanding and planning your approach, you’ll be better prepared to tackle LeetCode problems efficiently, ensuring both correctness and optimization.`,

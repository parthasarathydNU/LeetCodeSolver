# DSA Problem Solver - for those who hate DSA Problems

## Overview

The **DSA Problem Solver** project aims to simplify the process of solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems by leveraging advanced language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. This tool is designed to assist users in tackling challenging DSA problems, making the process more intuitive and less daunting.

## Features

- **Agentic LLM Integration**: Utilizes language models to understand and generate solutions for various DSA problems by breaking it down into simpler steps
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Enhances problem-solving capabilities by combining retrieval of latest information on the internet to support generation of tailored solutions.
- **Interactive Problem-Solving**: Allows users to interact with the tool, providing problem statements and receiving step-by-step solutions and explanations.
- **Solution Explanation**: Provides detailed explanations of solutions, including algorithmic steps, time complexity, and space complexity.

## Usage

1. **Input Problem Statement**:
   Provide the DSA problem statement either via the command line interface or through the web interface.

2. **Receive Solution**:
   The tool will analyze the problem using the Agentic LLM and RAG techniques, then provide a detailed solution with explanations.

3. **Explore Solutions**:
   Users can review the solutions and explanations, and interact with the tool for further clarification or alternative approaches.
